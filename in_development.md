![Basic level idea](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*6CU8l5D1gUlTaNDtA3jL3g.jpeg)

1. Build a Streamlit dashboard  
   - Who are your end users? People, hospitals, insurers?  
   - Manufacturing spend, negotiation, reimbursement, drug cluster, recall count (if any)  
   - Checkout vegetation price, crop price Streamlit work on GitHub

2. AI model for each end user separately or we can decide this as we go on ([streamlit/llm-examples](https://github.com/streamlit/llm-examples))
3. Drug events, drug recalls and policy changes impact to forecast drug prices
4. Checkout starred repos for Streamlit understanding


## Solutions/ Strategies

### 1. Refine Professional Pitch

“I’m a data science graduate with a strong focus on healthcare analytics and actuarial science. Currently, I’m developing a pharmaceutical data project and planning to open-source it to contribute to the community. I’m seeking opportunities as a healthcare data analyst to apply my analytical skills, gain firsthand industry exposure, and create impactful data-driven solutions.”

### 2. Strengthen Your Portfolio

Since already working on pharma data projects, make sure to showcase them in a way employers can see your process and impact:

1. Use GitHub to host code + documentation.
2. Write a medium-length blog/LinkedIn post explaining methods & insights.
3. Create visual dashboards (Tableau, PowerBI, or Streamlit) that demonstrate results clearly.

### 3. Strategic Open-Source Contribution

An open-source project in healthcare data can stand out if it’s practical. Some ideas:

1. Public datasets cleaning & preprocessing pipelines (many are messy).
2. A Python package for actuarial/healthcare risk modeling.
3. A dashboard template for drug safety/clinical trial visualization.

### 4. Landing Healthcare Analyst Roles

Since targeting healthcare analyst roles, here are a few entry points:

1. Healthcare providers (hospitals, clinics, insurance networks).
2. Pharma companies (real-world evidence, drug utilization, trials).
3. Health tech startups (digital health apps, AI in diagnostics).
4. Insurance firms (especially with your actuarial background).

#### Leverage:

LinkedIn networking: Reach out to analysts in those roles for 15–20 min chats.
Job boards specialized in healthcare (e.g., HIMSS JobMine, HealthEC, IQVIA careers).
Recruiters who focus on healthcare analytics.

### 5. Keep Industry Exposure Flowing

1. Try contract roles/freelance gigs on platforms like Upwork (lots of healthcare data needs).
2. Participate in healthcare hackathons (many hosted by Kaggle, MIT Hacking Medicine, etc.).
3. Join communities (e.g., HealthTech Twitter/LinkedIn groups, PyHealth open-source community).
